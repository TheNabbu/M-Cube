- **Calculations:** M Cube calculates the Mean, Mode, and Median based on the data you provide.

## Getting Started

To use M Cube, simply follow these steps:

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

2. Enter your data in the table:
   - For each row, input the lower and upper limits of a class interval in the first column.
   - Input the frequency in the second column.

3. Click the "Add Row" button to add more rows if needed.

4. Click the "Remove Row" button to remove rows if you have added too many.

5. Click the "Calculate" button to perform the calculations.

6. View the results for Mean, Mode, and Median on the right side of the interface.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use M Cube:

Suppose you have the following dataset:

| Class Intervals | Frequencies |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 10 - 20         | 5           |
| 20 - 30         | 8           |
| 30 - 40         | 12          |

1. Enter the class intervals and frequencies into the table.

2. Click "Calculate."

3. You will see the Mean, Mode, and Median displayed on the right side.
